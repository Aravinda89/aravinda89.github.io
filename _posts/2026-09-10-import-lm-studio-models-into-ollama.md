```text
FROM C:/Users/YOU/.cache/lm-studio/models/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-8B-GGUF/Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf

- **`ollama` not recognized?** Close PowerShell and open it again.

## FAQ ❓

**Does importing save disk space?**
No. Ollama makes its own copy of the model. You save download time, not space.

**Does this work with any LM Studio model?**
Yes, as long as the model is a `.gguf` file.

**Can I delete the model from LM Studio after importing?**
Yes! Ollama keeps its own copy, so it will still work. Just test it first. 😉
